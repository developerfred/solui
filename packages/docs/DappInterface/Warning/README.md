A Dapp author has to explicitly mark their Dapp as ready for production use on the Ethereum Mainnet. Otherwise, by default
the rendered Dapp UI will display a warning on every panel which looks like this:

![Warning](../../images/Warning.png)

This is intended as a safety measure to protect users.

Marking a Dapp as ready for production use involves setting a flag in the [specification](../../Specification).
